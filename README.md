  <em> macOS Mojave on a x230i </em>

You will need a Mac Disk Image File of the OS you want. When I tried this, I used an image of Mojave 10.14.3 with Clover. I would tell you how to get this file, but you are a smart and industrious person so I am sure can figure out that part on your own. Remember that you need a .dmg file.

Also remember that in the BIOS, change the boot option to UEFI instead of Legacy, and to switch the fn key and ctrl key since Thinkpad laptops and regular key placements are different.

When you succed in Hackintoshing your laptop, you will want to change your special keys to something you are more used to. Aside from the regular macOS keyboard settings, you can use Karabiner Elements to fully swap the actions of your keys to whatever you want.

Please keep in mind, that I had this Hackintosh for about a week. At the end of the week, I reflected and realized the if I was going to use macOS, I might as well use another UNIX based OS. I switched back to Linux. It was fun while it lasted, but at this point I can safely say a Linux/Windows dual boot is my way to go. For Linux, I prefer either Debian or Arch. I like using KDE Plasma as my desktop environment and window manager. However, a tiling window manager like i3, xmonad, or openbox is really good for efficiency if you can get the keyboard commands down. For now, I'm good with KWin.
